<notes>
	<p>Headings outline the organization of a document. Use headings to help structure your content so that it is clear and easy to understand.</p>
	<p><strong>Use Heading 1 to indicate a new page.</strong></p>
	<div class="note">
		<p>Be semantically-correct with your structure to make it easier for people that use <a href="https://www.nomensa.com/blog/2005/what-is-a-screen-reader">screen readers</a> to understand what you mean.</p>
		<p>A page shouldnâ€™t skip from a <strong>Heading 1</strong> to a <strong>Heading 3</strong> without a <strong>Heading 2</strong> in-between. Always try to step down one level at a time.</p>
	</div>
	<p>You can also use Heading 1 to request links to files in the Table of Contents. See the <a href="/home#essential-tips">Essential Tips</a> section for more information.</p>

		<h3>Developer Notes</h3>
		<p>A heading has margin space above and below it, and automatically forces paragraph text or images to begin on a new line below it.</p>
