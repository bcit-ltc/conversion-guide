                <p>The purpose of a log yard is to store logs delivered to a Sawmill until they are processed. The cost of logs represents 60-70% of the lumber production; hence, it is important to ensure the logs received meet the Sawmill’s requirements in terms of desirable species, log lengths, minimum top diameters, and knot and defect sizes and distributions. Any deviations from the Sawmill’s requirements can have an impact on the mill profit. Some of the common errors include bucking to incorrect lengths and log damage.</p>
                <p>In a log yard, logs are stored in piles for a determined period. Logs may biodegrade if stored for extended periods. The piles of logs can be sorted by age, species, or place of origin. It is important to arrange the piles in a log yard to minimize log handling and avoid physical damages to the logs, which leads to loss of recovery. Equally important is to avoid log contamination with dirt and rock, which can shorten the life of debarking/bucking equipment and affect hog quality.</p>

<notes>
    <p>Use a slider to conveniently display multiple images.</p>
    <p>Optional elements include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Title</li>
        <li><code>alt</code> text</li>
        <li>Caption text</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Images should be JPG, PNG or GIF files, preferably optimized for the web.</p>
    <p>File names are lowercase with no spaces or special characters.</p>
    <div class="note">
        <p>Caption text, by default, is displayed until the "Hide Caption" arrow is toggled.</p>
        <p>Include alternative (alt) text with images whenever possible. Alt text is, ideally, a short description that helps someone understand the image if they can’t see it.</p>
